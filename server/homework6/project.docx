Project Description

The purpose of this project was to create a shopping list app.

Conceptual Model

There are a total of 5 tables as described below.

I needed 3 main tables: users, lists, and items.
Additionally, I added 2 junction (join) tables, lists_users and lists_items, since I needed M:N relations.
For faster lookups, I added an index on the user IDs to the lists_users table and an index on the item IDs to the lists_items table.

Relational Schema

Criteria:
M:N users <=> lists
M:N items <=> lists

So I decided to create two junction tables, lists_users and lists_items.
